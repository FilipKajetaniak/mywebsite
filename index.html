              <h1>Dziecimamy &mdash;</h1>
              <p>Single page application blog with custom CMS made from scratch. It loads and renders data on server
                so search engines can analyze the content.

            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>I believe this app is super cool and let my tell you why.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It's a Single Page App</li>
                <li>It's SEO friendly</li>
                <li>It has a simple custom CMS</li>
                <li>Admin panel is secured</li>
                <li>It's responsive and cross browser compatible</li>
                <li>It has custom illustrations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                But most importantly, it's a legit app. It's not just a simple training project.
                It's deployed on a Node.js server, it has all the features a proper blog should have like
                SSL certificate, comments section, newsletter form, page sharing e.t.c. 
              </p>
            <h1>Technologies</h1>
            <p>
              Technologies used for this project are quite unusuall. You don't see blogs with this stack everyday.
              I used Vue.js for snappy and dynamic user interface. I also added Nuxt.js, which is an additional
              library / framework for server side rendering in Vue. Regarding back-end, I used GraphQL for fetching
              data from API and Graphcool as a database. GraphQL is essentially a better alternative to REST. It's
              a super new technology developed by Facebook team for more efficient API queries and mutations. Graphcool
              is a service that lets you set up a GraphQL database in a cloud server. To keep everything together and be
              able to render html on server I used Node.js. <br>
              Were these technologies the best choice for this kind of project? Not really. Using a Wordpress or Jekyll
              would be certainly much easier to make a blog. Despite some painful drawbacks I'm glad I've finished this
              project with this setup. I had to face tons of different problems which made me learn incomparably more
              than if I used a CMS.
